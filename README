VPork

Introduction
VPork is a utility for load-testing a distributed hash table (namely, project Voldemort).


Capabilities
VPork was written with a fairly specific use-case in mind, but provides a fairly general pattern of access:

    * A single JVM is started, with any number of client threads
    * Each thread executes for a given number of iterations
    * For each iteration, the thread can read an existing record, and/or create a new one
    * The probability of each read/write is configurable
    * The location of where reads happen is configurable (by default, it reads the most recently written records, trailing off to less frequent reads of writes which occurred long ago)


Pre-Requisites
These steps already assume that you have Voldemort up and running in a cluster. The project ships with very useful tools for starting/stopping/resetting a cluster, and vpork is able to use the configurations from your Voldemort deployment. In this documentation we will assume project-voldemort is installed in:
/mnt/project-voldemort

VPork also requires groovy, which can be obtained at groovy.codehaus.org


Install / Configure

Download vpork:

$ git clone git://github.com/trav/vpork.git

Install an appropriate stores.xml file. VPork ships with a file in templates/perfstores.xml, which contains a store called ‘bytez’ which is used by VPork. You can copy perfstores.xml directly to your configuration directory or make similar changes to your existing configs:

$ cp templates/perfstores.xml /mnt/project-voldemort/config/single_node_cluster/config/stores.xml
Deal out the Porking

$ ./vpork.sh configs/voldemort/30-thread-pork.groovy configs/voldemort/nodes.conf

If everything is working, you should see results in results/30-thread-pork-0


Log files

The output of VPork is put into a test-versioned directory with snapshots of your Voldemort configurations:

$ cat results/30-thread-pork-0/progress.log
